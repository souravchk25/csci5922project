## How to run?
(1) Install Blender v2.78 and launch it from the terminal.

(2) Load the file "render_rgbd_3d_from_CAD.blend", and just click the button "Run Script".

(3) Both RGB and depth images will be rendered from different viewing angles. The full 3D CAD model will be voxelized as well. 

Note that, the voxelization could be slow if the xyz dimensions are more than 256. You may modify it to parallel computing. You may also turn to use the existing tool "binvox" which is much faster.
